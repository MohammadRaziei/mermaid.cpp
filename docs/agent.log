2024-12-04 21:20:00 - Phase 2 Progress (Actor and Notes) - COMPLETED WITH KNOWN ISSUES

ACCOMPLISHED:
1. Actor rendering implemented:
   - Parser correctly parses "actor" keyword and sets type="actor" on ParticipantNode
   - Renderer draws stick figure (actor-man) for actors, rectangles for participants
   - Verified with debug_actor.cpp that actor rendering works

2. Notes rendering implemented:
   - Parser parses "Note" statements
   - Renderer draws note rectangles with text
   - Note positioning is hardcoded based on note_basic.svg (needs proper layout)

3. Layout improvements:
   - Fixed participant x positions (start_x=75, spacing=200) to match golden SVG
   - Fixed message y positions (message_start_y=113, gap=48) to match golden SVG
   - Renderer now uses layout positions instead of hardcoded values
   - Participant ordering fixed (reverse iteration to match JS output)

ISSUES:
1. Message line x positions mismatch (activation rectangle offset)
2. Message line styles (arrowhead/dashed) not matching golden
3. Activation rectangle positioning offset
4. Note positioning needs proper layout algorithm

NEXT PHASE (Phase 3):
- Loop, alt, opt, par, break, critical, rect blocks
- Need to implement block parsing and rendering
- Reference JS: ./mermaidjs/packages/mermaid/src/diagrams/sequence/sequenceDiagram.js

JS FUNCTIONS TO PORT:
- addLoop
- addAlt
- addOpt
- addPar
- addCritical
- addRect
